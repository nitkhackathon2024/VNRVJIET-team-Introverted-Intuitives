## Problem Statement
We are working under the [Quantum Computing for Machine Learning] theme, which aims to explore the application of quantum computing to enhance machine learning models.

Problem Statement
The problem statement we are addressing is "Comparison of Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models". In this project, we focus on evaluating the performance of a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) model against traditional classical machine learning models.

Our goal is to:

Implement a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) model using a quantum computing framework.
Compare the VQC model with classical machine learning models on a given dataset.
Analyze and benchmark the models based on accuracy, performance, and scalability.
This comparison provides insights into the current capabilities of quantum machine learning and its potential advantages over classical approaches in specific scenarios.
